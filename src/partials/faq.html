              Yes, Tile Rush is entirely free to download and play. All levels
              can be accessed without any payment. While there are optional
              in-game purchases available (such as boosters or visual themes),
              none of them are necessary to enjoy the full experience. We’ve
              carefully designed the game to ensure that progress is possible
              for all players without ever needing to spend money. Our goal is
              to provide a relaxing puzzle journey without any paywalls. Players
              who want to support us can do so through these optional extras.

              No, you do not need an internet connection to enjoy the game. Tile
              Rush is fully playable offline, making it ideal for travel,
              commutes, or relaxing moments without Wi-Fi or mobile data. All
              features, including boosters and Zen Mode, are accessible in
              offline mode. The game only requires an internet connection if
              you're updating it or making an optional purchase. This allows you
              to enjoy uninterrupted gameplay wherever you are. It’s truly a
              game that travels with you.

              Tile Rush stands out for its relaxing, no-pressure approach.
              Unlike many other puzzle games, there are no timers, no intrusive
              ads, and no lives system that forces you to wait or pay. The pace
              is entirely up to the player. Every level is designed to be both
              calming and intellectually satisfying. In addition, our Zen Mode
              offers an endless play option with no objectives—just peaceful
              matching. Combined with high-quality visuals and intuitive
              gameplay, it’s the perfect escape from fast-paced mobile games.

              Boosters are tools you can use to help clear difficult levels.
              They include Hint Spark, Tile Swap, and Clear Set, each serving a
              different purpose. You can earn boosters by completing certain
              levels, finding extra matches, or through optional purchases. They
              are not essential for completing levels, but they’re helpful for
              when you feel stuck or want a bit of an edge. We made sure
              boosters are balanced so that gameplay remains fair and rewarding.
              Using them is completely optional and up to you.

              Yes, we continuously work on expanding the game. With each major
              update, we introduce new levels, puzzles, and sometimes even
              special themed events. We also listen to community feedback to
              improve level design and adjust difficulty where needed. These
              updates are rolled out automatically if you’re connected to the
              internet. You’ll be notified when new content becomes available.
              Our development roadmap includes seasonal tilesets and monthly
              puzzle packs to keep the game feeling fresh.

              Zen Mode is a special game mode where there are no goals or level
              restrictions. You simply match tiles in an endless loop designed
              for relaxation. There’s no pressure to complete objectives or earn
              stars—just pure gameplay flow. It’s perfect for winding down after
              a long day or taking a mindful break. Many players use it for
              stress relief or background play while listening to music or
              podcasts. You can switch to Zen Mode from the main menu anytime.

              Tile Rush is designed to be accessible and enjoyable for players
              of all ages. The early levels are simple enough for beginners and
              children, while later stages become more strategic and complex.
              There are no time limits, which removes unnecessary stress and
              allows players to learn at their own pace. The interface is
              intuitive and easy to navigate, making it suitable for younger
              players. At the same time, puzzle enthusiasts will find enough
              depth in the later levels to stay engaged and challenged.

              Currently, Tile Rush does not offer cross-device syncing. Your
              progress is saved locally on the device where you play. However,
              we are working on implementing a cloud-save feature in a future
              update, which will allow you to continue playing seamlessly on
              other devices. In the meantime, we recommend backing up your
              device regularly to avoid any accidental data loss. Once cloud
              sync becomes available, you’ll receive a notification with setup
              instructions. We know this is important and appreciate your
              patience.

              No, Tile Rush is an ad-free experience by default. We believe that
              uninterrupted play is key to relaxation, which is why we do not
              serve video ads or interstitial pop-ups. All our monetization is
              based on optional in-game purchases only. This means you can enjoy
              as many levels as you want without being interrupted. If this ever
              changes, we’ll offer ad-free versions and be transparent about the
              choices. For now, we’re proud to provide a clean and calm puzzle
              environment.

              Yes, Tile Rush is designed to be family-friendly. The game does
              not contain any explicit content, microtransactions that encourage
              excessive spending, or social features requiring parental
              supervision. It’s a safe, calm, and enriching experience that
              supports logical thinking and pattern recognition. We do recommend
              that parents monitor very young children during play to help them
              understand the controls and avoid accidental purchases. Otherwise,
              it’s a great game for kids to enjoy independently or with family.
